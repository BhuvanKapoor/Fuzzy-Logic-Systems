# Fuzzy Logic Systems

This repository contains implementations of two fuzzy logic systems: a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) and a Fuzzy Pattern Recognition System (FPRS). Fuzzy logic offers a flexible and intuitive framework for modeling uncertainty and imprecision, making it suitable for various applications in decision-making, control systems, and pattern recognition.

## Fuzzy Inference System

The Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) is a computational model that uses fuzzy logic to approximate reasoning in systems with uncertain or vague input data. It consists of fuzzy sets, linguistic variables, fuzzy rules, and an inference mechanism. The FIS in this repository is designed to perform specific tasks by mapping input variables to output variables based on predefined rules and membership functions.

## Fuzzy Pattern Recognition System

The Fuzzy Pattern Recognition System (FPRS) is an intelligent system capable of recognizing patterns in data using fuzzy logic principles. Unlike traditional pattern recognition methods that rely on crisp decision boundaries, FPRS accounts for uncertainties and ambiguities in the data, resulting in more robust and flexible pattern recognition capabilities. This system is particularly useful for tasks where precise categorization may not be feasible due to complex or overlapping patterns.
